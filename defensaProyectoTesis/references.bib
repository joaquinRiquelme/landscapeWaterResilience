However, it is still unknown how hydrological processes and streamflow respond to changes in landscape configuration and composition in hydrological basins. The relationship between landscape metrics and hydrological variables in two Chilean basins was analyzed for the last 4 decades. Aggregation, shape and diversity metrics were obtained using Fragstats software, and hydrological components were simulated by the TETIS hydrological model. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and partial least squares (PLSR) analysis were used to determine how landscape patterns influence hydrological processes and streamflow behavior. The most significant negative correlations occur in the wet season between aggregation and shape metrics on crop soils and evapotranspiration, infiltration, and baseflow regime behavior. The PLSR analysis shows that the second component-related landscape metrics of young plantations explain the highest percentage of variation in hydrological components. The results of this research improve our understanding of the effects of landscape configuration and composition on the hydrological cycle and can be used for land planning and water resource management within the basins.},

In this context, simulation models are valuable tools for investigating the impacts of stakeholder actions or policy decisions. Agricultural landscape generators (ALGs), which systematically and automatically generate realistic but simplified representations of land cover in agricultural landscapes, can provide the input for LUCC models. We reviewed existing ALGs in terms of their objectives, design and scope. We found eight ALGs that met our definition. They were based either on generic mathematical algorithms (pattern-based) or on representations of ecological or land use processes (process-based). Most ALGs integrate only a few landscape metrics, which limits the design of the landscape pattern and thus the range of applications. For example, only a few specific farming systems have been implemented. We conclude that existing ALGs contain useful approaches that can be used for specific purposes, but ideally generic modular ALGs are developed that can be used for a wide range of scenarios, regions and model types. We have compiled features of such generic ALGs and propose a possible software architecture. Considerable joint efforts are required to develop such generic ALGs, but the benefits in terms of a better understanding and development of more efficient agricultural policies would be high.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem service assessment has recently become one of the most important scientific frameworks to address the challenges inherent in environmental management, particularly those in agroecosystem management. Agroecosystems provide important ecosystem services to society including provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. However, the Mediterranean Basin agroecosystems have suffered the effects of two drivers of change, rural abandonment and intensification of agrarian practices, which threaten multifunctional landscapes and erode the capacity to deliver ecosystem services. In this study, we explored the knowledge landscape of ecosystem services research throughout the Mediterranean Basin's agroecosystems through a review of 165 publications. We (1) analyzed the current research state and trends; (2) examined the existing research gaps and biases; and (3) evaluated the associations between factors related to the methodologies employed, the ecosystem services analyzed, and the agroecosystem characteristics. Our results indicated that monetary approaches and provisioning ecosystem services are attracting most of the scientific attention, possibly jeopardizing the regulating and cultural services provided by these ecosystems. Moreover, results suggested that there is a lack of integrated approaches that consider the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. biophysical, sociocultural and monetary. Most studies did not use primary data or involve stakeholders in the assessments and scarce evidence was available regarding ecosystem services provided under different management alternatives. Finally, specific relationships were detected between the methodologies applied, the ecosystem services assessed and the characteristics of the agroecosystem. We argue these gaps might have potential implications in current scientific and political debates, such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the Common Agricultural Policy reform. We therefore provide recommendations for research and policy-making, agendas.},

Soil moisture, though a small fraction of Earth\&rsquo;s water, plays a fundamental role in terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, influencing meteorological processes, plant health, soil biogeochemistry, groundwater fluctuations, and nutrient exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. However, understanding and modeling soil moisture dynamics is extremely complex due to the non-linear interplay of numerous physical and biological processes, the large number of drivers involved, and the wide range of spatial and temporal scales at play. Here, we focused on a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden, where we monitored surface soil moisture with dataloggers at 82 locations during the 2022 vegetation period. We described spatial patterns and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture, we explored the relationships between the observed variations in soil moisture and a vast array of environmental and meteorological factors from multiple sources at varying spatial resolutions and temporal scales, and we tested how these relationships changed over time. Soil properties, topographical features, vegetation characteristics, and land use/land cover were all important contributors of spatial variations in soil moisture, suggesting that current soil moisture maps primarily relying on terrain indices could benefit from integrating this diverse range of information. Moreover, different spatial resolutions and user-defined thresholds of these indices largely affected the performance of the predictions, indicating that topographic proxies for soil moisture should be evaluated for the specific area of interest. Hydrological and meteorological conditions over five to seven days preceding soil moisture measurements were essential in explaining daily soil moisture fluctuations, and influenced the predominant mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Our findings contribute to advancing physically based land surface and hydrological models, developing machine learning models for predicting spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture, and ultimately generating digital dynamic soil moisture maps for forest management and nature conservation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, no detailed description of the underlying effects of the surface forcing of the atmosphere has been established. In this study, GLEAM, MODIS, and ERA5 were the input set of multiple analysis algorithms, 'segmentation' was the core idea of the analysis method. The study area is segmented into six surface response functional groups, and the multidimensional evaporation regime function was segmented into piecewise functions controlled by segment authoritative variables. Inspired by the surface heat balance equation and moisture-limited, energy-limited evaporation regimes, we chose soil moisture content and the net radiation flux to represent the moisture and energy status, respectively, and chose the leaf area index (LAI) to characterize the vegetation cover to investigate the primary effects of surface parameters on the energy partitioning of the land surface and evaporative regime. The results show that though a coupling strength 1.8 times greater was obtained when the LAI was used as the response variable instead of soil moisture, soil moisture was still the highest response variable in the regression tree analysis. This is consistent with the essence of the evaporative fraction and indicates that water should be the most fundamental response variable. The evaporative regime was subdivided from two phases into five phases according to the effects such as water extraction by vegetation, photosynthesis, soil shading, and roughness changes, each with an authoritative response variable.},

	abstract = {Agriculture in the Aconcagua Basin is both vital to Chile’s economy and critically dependent on water resources from snow and glaciers. Expanding croplands, a growing population, and a changing climate are all expected to exacerbate water scarcity in this arid region where agriculture requires 7.1 × 108 m3 of water for irrigation annually. We investigate agricultural water resources in the Aconcagua Basin by examining the drivers of and trends in river discharge, calculating approximate crop water demand, and assessing the potential for future water scarcity given discharge rates and agricultural demand. We find that growing-season (October to March) discharge is significantly correlated with austral winter precipitation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Austral winter precipitation provides snow that melts during the growing season, supplying water for agricultural irrigation. Time series analysis shows that temperature increased by 0.23°C per decade between 1965 and 2017, and snow cover frequency decreased 2.7\% per decade over the relatively short time period of 2000 to 2017. Based on historical discharge data and our assessment of current agricultural water demand, we show that the Aconcagua Basin is already water-scarce, experiencing demand exceeding supply approximately three out of every 10 years.},

Many agroecosystems are exposed to more extreme weather and further declines in rainfall under climate change unless adaptations increase the retention of water in landscapes, and its recycling back to the lower atmosphere. Vegetation systems provide vital feedbacks to mechanisms that underpin water vapour recycling between micro- and meso-scales. Various heterogeneous forms of vegetation can help generate atmospheric conditions conducive to precipitation, and therefore, increase the resilience of agroecosystems to drought and climatic extremes. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how vegetation can be designed for agroecosystems to enhance recycling of water vapour to the atmosphere through the regulation of surface water and wind, and heat fluxes. The structure of the paper revolves around five functions of integrated vegetation designs that can help underpin the restoration of water recycling through enhanced retention of stormwater, protection from wind, moistening and cooling the landscape, production of plant litter, and contribution toward regional scale climate and catchment functioning. We also present two supplementary functions relevant to land and natural resource managers which may also be integrated using these designs.},

	abstract = {Due to a rapid increase in accessible Earth observation data coupled with high computing and storage capabilities, multiple efforts over the past few years have aimed to map land use/land cover using image time series with promising outcomes. Here, we evaluate the comparative performance of alternative land cover classifications generated by using only (1) phenological metrics derived from either of two land surface phenology models, or (2) a suite of spectral band percentiles and normalized ratios (spectral variables), or (3) a combination of phenological metrics and spectral variables. First, several annual time series of remotely sensed data were assembled: Accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day land surface temperature products, 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), and the spectral variables from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, as well as from the U.S. Landsat Analysis Ready Data surface reflectance products. Then, at each pixel, EVI2 time series were fitted using two different land surface phenology models: The Convex Quadratic model (CxQ), in which EVI2 = f(AGDD) and the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model (HPLM), in which EVI2 = f(day of year). Phenometrics and spectral variables were submitted separately and together to Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) to depict land use/land cover in Roberts County, South Dakota. HPLM RFC models showed slightly better accuracy than CxQ RFC models (about 1\% relative higher in overall accuracy). Compared to phenometrically-based RFC models, spectrally-based RFC models yielded more accurate land cover maps, especially for non-crop cover types. However, the RFC models built from spectral variables could not accurately classify the wheat class, which contained mostly spring wheat with some fields in durum or winter varieties. The most accurate RFC models were obtained when using both phenometrics and spectral variables as inputs. The combined-variable RFC models overcame weaknesses of both phenometrically-based classification (low accuracy for non-vegetated covers) and spectrally-based classification (low accuracy for wheat). The analysis of important variables indicated that land cover classification for this study area was strongly driven by variables related to the initial green-up phase of seasonal growth and maximum fitted EVI2. For a deeper evaluation of RFC performance, RFC classifications were also executed with several alternative sampling scenarios, including different spatiotemporal filters to improve accuracy of sample pools and different sample sizes. Results indicated that a sample pool with less filtering yielded the most accurate predicted land cover map and a stratified random sample dataset covering approximately 0.25\% or more of the study area were required to achieve an accurate land cover map. In case of data scarcity, a smaller dataset might be acceptable, but should not smaller than 0.05\% of the study area.},

Their predicted increase in recurrence and intensity poses serious threats to future food security. Still today, the knowledge of how droughts and heatwaves start and evolve remains limited, and so does our understanding of how climate change may affect them. Droughts and heatwaves have been suggested to intensify and propagate via land–atmosphere feedbacks. However, a global capacity to observe these processes is still lacking, and climate and forecast models are immature when it comes to representing the influences of land on temperature and rainfall. Key open questions remain in our goal to uncover the real importance of these feedbacks: What is the impact of the extreme meteorological conditions on ecosystem evaporation? How do these anomalies regulate the atmospheric boundary layer state (event self-intensification) and contribute to the inflow of heat and moisture to other regions (event self-propagation)? Can this knowledge on the role of land feedbacks, when available, be exploited to develop geo-engineering mitigation strategies that prevent these events from aggravating during their early stages? The goal of our perspective is not to present a convincing answer to these questions, but to assess the scientific progress to date, while highlighting new and innovative avenues to keep advancing our understanding in the future.},

	abstract = {Managing agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity and ecosystem services is a key aim of a sustainable agriculture. However, how the spatial arrangement of crop fields and other habitats in landscapes impacts arthropods and their functions is poorly known. Synthesising data from 49 studies (1515 landscapes) across Europe, we examined effects of landscape composition (\% habitats) and configuration (edge density) on arthropods in fields and their margins, pest control, pollination and yields. Configuration effects interacted with the proportions of crop and non-crop habitats, and species’ dietary, dispersal and overwintering traits led to contrasting responses to landscape variables. Overall, however, in landscapes with high edge density, 70\% of pollinator and 44\% of natural enemy species reached highest abundances and pollination and pest control improved 1.7- and 1.4-fold respectively. Arable-dominated landscapes with high edge densities achieved high yields. This suggests that enhancing edge density in European agroecosystems can promote functional biodiversity and yield-enhancing ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Pressure to increase food production to meet the demands of a growing human population can make conservation-motivated recommendations to limit agricultural expansion impractical. Therefore, we need to identify conservation actions that can support biodiversity without taking land out of production. Previous studies suggest this can be accomplished by increasing “farmland heterogeneity”—i.e. heterogeneity of the cropped portions of agricultural landscapes—by, for example, decreasing field sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether policies/guidelines that promote farmland heterogeneity will be as effective as those targeting farming practices. Here, we estimated the relative effects of six practices—annual/perennial crop, fertilizer use, herbicide use, insecticide use, tile drainage, and tillage—versus two aspects of farmland heterogeneity—field size and crop diversity—on the diversity of herbaceous plants, woody plants, butterflies, syrphid flies, bees, carabid beetles, spiders, and birds in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. The strength of effect of farming practices and farmland heterogeneity varied among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we found important effects of both farming practices and farmland heterogeneity on the combined (multi) diversity across these groups. In particular, we found greater multidiversity in untilled, perennial crop fields than tilled, annual crop fields, and greater multidiversity in agricultural landscapes with smaller crop fields and less diverse crops. The directions of effect of these variables were generally consistent across individual taxonomic groups. For example, richness was lower in landscapes with larger fields and more diverse crops than in landscapes with smaller fields and less diverse crops for all taxa except spiders. The negative effect of crop diversity on multidiversity and the richness of most of the studied taxa indicates that this aspect of farmland heterogeneity does not necessarily benefit wildlife species. Nevertheless, a compelling implication of this study is that it suggests that policies/guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes would be at least as effective for conservation of biodiversity within working agricultural landscapes as those designed to promote a wildlife-friendly farming practice.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is taking place at an unprecedented rate around the world, particularly in China in the past few decades. One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on UHI is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. This study investigated how landscape composition and configuration would affect UHI in the Shanghai metropolitan region of China, based on the analysis of land surface temperature (LST) in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation fraction (Fv), and percent impervious surface area (ISA). Two Landsat ETM+ images acquired on March 13 and July 2, 2001 were used to estimate LST, Fv, and percent ISA. Landscape metrics were calculated from a high spatial resolution (2.5×2.5m) land-cover/land-use map. Our results have showed that, although there are significant variations in LST at a given fraction of vegetation or impervious surface on a per-pixel basis, NDVI, Fv, and percent ISA are all good predictors of LST on the regional scale. There is a strong negative linear relationship between LST and positive NDVI over the region. Similar but stronger negative linear relationship exists between LST and Fv. Urban vegetation could mitigate the surface UHI better in summer than in early spring. A strong positive relationship exists between mean LST and percent ISA. The residential land is the biggest contributor to UHI, followed by industrial land. Although industrial land has the highest LST, it has limited contribution to the overall surface UHI due to its small spatial extend in Shanghai. Among the residential land-uses, areas with low- to-middle-rise buildings and low vegetation cover have much high temperatures than areas with high-rise buildings or areas with high vegetation cover. A strong correlation between the mean LST and landscape metrics indicates that urban landscape configuration also influences the surface UHI. These findings are helpful for understanding urban ecology as well as land use planning to minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization.},

	abstract = {Agricultural and ecological modelers commonly use maps as input for spatially explicit simulations. While real world maps are often used, they are limited by being static objects, therefore making it difficult to assess how patterns within the landscape contribute to ecological processes. Agricultural landscape generators (ALG) are a useful tool for simulating maps in a more flexible way. They can increase robustness of models that rely on landscape maps as input, they allow modelers to give spatial representation to non-spatial models, and they are a useful tool for recreating spatial patterns in agricultural-dominated landscapes. A limitation of previous ALGs is that they have rarely been designed for general use (non-open source software, not written in R, and designed for specific projects). Furthermore, they are typically either extremely general and thus oversimplified or have a high specificity for particular use cases.ALGR bridges this gap by providing a general-purpose, dynamic landscape generator that balances structural realism with adaptability. ALGR generates agricultural landscapes with a three-step approach: first, outlining potential space, second, field placement inside of that space, and third, enrichment of the landscape with information. This stepwise approach ensures that ALGR generates landscapes with realistic spatial patterns while remaining adaptable to diverse regions and applications.It is the first ALG that is specifically designed to allow a simple integration within the R programming environment and the r-spatial package environment. ALGR is designed as a general-purpose generator, which is simple to use and facilitates an easy integration in modelling workflow.We present several examples of workflows using ALGR, to demonstrate its usefulness. Our examples include: 1) simulating different land use shares, 2) parameter tuning of ALGR to recreate real world landscape patterns 3) spatially distributing crop portfolios, and 4) using real world maps as a basis for field placement

	abstract = {In ecology, especially in plant ecology, it is commonplace to identify and quantify spatial patterns (Greig-Smith 1952, 1964; Kershaw 1964). In fact, most ecological data are inherently composed of several levels of spatial structure: large-scale trends (species responses to climate conditions, to migration process, etc.), small scale patterns, patchiness (weather conditions, physical conditions, dispersal mechanisms, predation, competition, etc.), and local random noise. Therefore, the notion of spatial autocorrelation implies that “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” (Tobler 1970) and “with spatial data, there is a better than random chance that one can predict attribute values from a given areal unit from those taken on by its juxtaposed areal units …” (Haining 1980). Griffith (1992) provides several other definitions of spatial autocorrelation, which include “a diagnostic tool for spatial model misspecification; a surrogate for unobserved geographical variables; a nuisance in applying conventional statistical methodology to spatial data series; an indicator of the appropriateness of, and possible artifact of, areal unit demarcation.”},

In broad terms, agroecology prioritizes diversity while sidelining productivity and adheres to relational epistemology, while sustainable intensification emphasizes boosting crop production while reducing environmental impact within a reductionist epistemology. Both discourses claim to have the solution to agricultural sustainability but are largely inexplicit about their guiding assumptions and their own limitations, and rarely engage with research in the other discourse.

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ‘functional landscape heterogeneity’. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.},

This fact was illustrated after an exhaustive analytical review of the different agroecosystem definitions proposed and currently used in the literature. We reviewed 157 articles and other key scientific literature and found seven different concepts. It is necessary to advance in unification of the terminology to bridge the gaps among agroecology, agricultural sciences, and other disciplines that enable progress toward sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to propose a discussion about the need to have a semantic and operational concept of agroecosystem. Agroecosystem is a synthesis, product of the culture – nature interaction, it is regarded as a homogeneous natural unit, where an agrotechnological management system (AMS) is introduced according to farmer needs. Therefore, the agroecosystem is a holistic, irreducible, and particular basic unit of agroecology and the agricultural sciences, which integrates production processes and attributes for a sustainable agriculture.},

	abstract = {When changes are made in a landscape, these changes may impact on the local climate. In arid and semi-arid agroecosystems, measures such as Landscape Restoration and Water Harvesting (LRWH) are implemented in order to revert land degradation and increase agricultural yields, by means of reducing runoff losses and increasing soil moisture. The present work analyses to what extent storing soil moisture, with adequate land and water management practices, can reduce temperatures in the hot months after the rainy season in a semi-arid climate. Since it is reported that Soil Moisture (SM) deficit can enhance heatwaves in diverse regions of the world because of Soil Moisture-Temperature Coupling (SMTC), it is hypothesized that increasing soil water availability, during the dry and hot periods, can mitigate hot temperatures. The analysis was carried for Enabered catchment, in Tigray Region, Ethiopia, where the rainy season runs from June to September. Here, large scale LRWH implementation ended in 2008. Using remote sensing data, the present study evaluates (1) to what extent LRWH implementation can enhance SM conservation at agroecosystem scale; (2) to what extent LRWH implementation can mitigate temperatures in the dry season at agroecosystem scale; and (3) the evidence of SMTC effects. Results show an increased capacity of the catchment to maintain SM accumulated in the rainy season and consequent reduced temperatures. Increase of SM was especially significant for September (P {\textless} 0.01), while temperature decrease was evident in October (P {\textless} 0.01) and November (P {\textless} 0.05), with decreases of Land Surface Temperatures (LST) up to 1.74 °C A simple, parsimonious linear regression model demonstrates that SMTC is evident at catchment scale and that the implementation of LRWH measures provides a climate regulation effect in the watershed. The present work can reinforce the call for an increased adoption of water harvesting, land restoration and green water management, in order to increase the resilience of agricultural ecosystem and food security in arid and semi-arid areas.},

Incorporating greater landscape heterogeneity in cropped areas, especially by increasing crop diversity and the density of field edges (i.e. greater farmland heterogeneity), may be a key lever to increase non-food ES provision in agricultural landscapes. However, most work to date focuses on the effects of farmland heterogeneity on biodiversity or on a single ES at a single spatial scale. Understanding how farmland heterogeneity affects multiple ES across spatial scales is critical to exploring whether increasing this heterogeneity is a feasible management solution to increase ES provision in agricultural landscapes. We measured the effects of farmland heterogeneity on the provision of eight key ES (crop production, soil fertility, water quality regulation, carbon storage, bee and syrphid pollination, and aphid and defoliator regulation) in the Montérégie, an important agricultural region in Quebec, Canada. We sampled 32 soybean fields embedded within landscapes that fell along independent gradients of mean field size and crop diversity. We evaluated the effects of heterogeneity on these eight ES at two spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m radii around fields), while controlling for the effects of in-field management practices. We found that the mean size of agricultural fields had a stronger influence on ES provision than crop diversity, especially at the 500 m scale. We observed varying responses to mean field size for different ES, which may lead to trade-offs for landscape management. Landscapes with smaller fields benefitted from greater bee pollination, water quality regulation and defoliator regulation, but had less crop production and aphid regulation. To further explore these trade-offs, we calculated the multiple ecosystem service landscape index to assess multifunctionality, but found no significant relationship between mean field size and multifunctionality and a negative relationship between crop diversity and multifunctionality. Our findings show that different ES respond differently to changes in heterogeneity, and efforts to manage heterogeneity to improve ES provision will need to acknowledge and understand possible trade-offs, particularly for crop production and pest regulation services.},

	abstract = {Agroecosystem function is related to the positioning of the agroecosystem and its connectivity relationship with the surrounding landscape. Herein, three methodologies are presented, which allow assessment of the links between agroecosystems and the surrounding matrix, yielding information for promoting patterns and mechanisms that foster biodiversity and the provision of multiple ecosystem services such as biological pest control, as well as energy flows and material exchanges. The three methodologies are complementary when assessing agrolandscape-level interactions in situations of regional agroecological transition. Through the use of 11 indicators, a methodology (Assessment of Beneficial Insect Habitat Suitability-ABIHS) was applied in two northern California vineyards to determine whether each agrolandscape provided suitable environmental opportunities to sponsor biological insect pest control. The Main Agroecological Structure [MAS] applied in Chilean family farms elucidates some of the relationships between farms and their biophysical environment, generating data to analyze the links between agroecosystem landscapes, management practices, and insect diversity in family farms. Social Agrarian metabolism (SAM) applied in Spanish agrolandscapes quantifies the biophysical and energy flows in agricultural systems, testing whether such flows are capable of reproducing and/or improving fund elements such as soil, biodiversity, and landscape vegetation in successive production cycles. The three methodologies provide key information for the design of sustainable agroecosystems in the context of an agroecological transition.},

However, VI-based results can vary between indices, sensors, quality control measures, compositing algorithms, and atmospheric and sun–target–sensor geometry corrections. These variations make it difficult to draw robust conclusions about ecosystem change and highlight the need for consistent VI application and verification. In this Technical Review, we summarize the history and ecological applications of VIs and the linkages and inconsistencies between them. VIs have been used since the early 1970s and have evolved rapidly with the emergence of new satellite sensors with more spectral channels, new scientific demands and advances in spectroscopy. When choosing VIs, the spectral sensitivity and features of VIs and their suitability for target application should be considered. During data analyses, steps must be taken to minimize the impact of artefacts, VI results should be verified with in situ data when possible and conclusions should be based on multiple sets of indicators. Next-generation VIs with higher signal-to-noise ratios and fewer artefacts will be possible with new satellite missions and integration with emerging vegetation metrics such as solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, providing opportunities for studying terrestrial ecosystems globally.},

Over six weeks, an international team of {\textasciitilde}150 scientists collected data across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems in South Africa. In situ biodiversity observations of plant and animal communities, estuaries, kelp, and plankton were made using traditional field methods as well as novel approaches like environmental DNA and acoustic surveys. Biodiversity observations were accompanied by an unprecedented combination of airborne imaging spectroscopy and lidar measurements acquired across 45,000 km2.

This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition. Linking remote sensing products to EBVs will accelerate product generation, improving reporting on the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.},

	abstract = {Transpiration is a globally important component of evapotranspiration. Careful upscaling of transpiration from point measurements is thus crucial for quantifying water and energy fluxes. In spatially heterogeneous landscapes common across the boreal biome, upscaled transpiration estimates are difficult to determine due to variation in local environmental conditions (e.g., basal area, soil moisture, permafrost). Here, we sought to determine stand-level attributes that influence transpiration scalars for a forested boreal peatland complex consisting of sparsely treed wetlands and densely treed permafrost plateaus as land cover types. The objectives were to quantify spatial and temporal variability in stand-level transpiration, and to identify sources of uncertainty when scaling point measurements to the stand-level. Using heat ratio method sap flow sensors, we determined sap velocity for black spruce and tamarack for 2-week periods during peak growing season in 2013, 2017 and 2018. We found greater basal area, drier soils, and the presence of permafrost increased daily sap velocity in individual trees, suggesting that local environmental conditions are important in dictating sap velocity. When sap velocity was scaled to stand-level transpiration using gridded 20 × 20 m resolution data across the 10 ha Scotty Creek ForestGEO plot, we observed significant differences in daily plot transpiration among years (0.17–0.30 mm), and across land cover types. Daily transpiration was lowest in grid-cells with sparsely treed wetlands compared to grid-cells with well-drained and densely treed permafrost plateaus, where daily transpiration reached 0.80 mm, or 30\% of the daily evapotranspiration. When transpiration scalars (i.e., sap velocity) were not specific to the different land cover types (i.e., permafrost plateaus and wetlands), scaled stand-level transpiration was overestimated by 42\%. To quantify the relative contribution of tree transpiration to ecosystem evapotranspiration, we recommend that sampling designs stratify across local environmental conditions to accurately represent variation associated with land cover types, especially with different hydrological functioning as encountered in rapidly thawing boreal peatland complexes.},

	abstract = {The agriculture sector provides the majority of food supplies, ensures food security, and promotes sustainable development. Due to recent climate changes as well as trends in human population growth and environmental degradation, the need for timely agricultural information continues to rise. This study analyzes and predicts the impacts of climate change on food security (FS). For 2002–2021, Landsat, MODIS satellite images and predisposing variables (land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration, precipitation, sunny days, cloud ratio, soil salinity, soil moisture, groundwater quality, soil types, digital elevation model, slope, and aspect) were used. First, we used a deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to detect agricultural land (AL). A remote sensing-based approach combined with the analytical network process (ANP) model was used to identify frost-affected areas. We then analyzed the relationship between climatic, geospatial, and topographical variables and AL and frost-affected areas. We found negative correlations of − 0.80, − 0.58, − 0.43, and − 0.45 between AL and LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, and soil salinity, respectively. There is a positive correlation between AL and precipitation, sunny days, soil moisture, and groundwater quality of 0.39, 0.25, 0.21, and 0.77, respectively. The correlation between frost-affected areas and LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, elevation, slope, and aspect are 0.55, 0.40, 0.52, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.39. Frost-affected areas have negative correlations with precipitation, sunny day, and soil moisture of − 0.68, − 0.23, and − 0.38, respectively. Our findings show that the increase in LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, and soil salinity is associated with the decrease in AL. Additionally, AL decreases with a decreasing in precipitation, sunny days, soil moisture, and groundwater quality. It was also found that as LST, evapotranspiration, cloud ratio, elevation, slope, and aspect increase, frost-affected areas increase as well. Furthermore, frost-affected areas increase when precipitation, sunny days, and soil moisture decrease. Finally, we predicted the FS threat for 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2060 using the CA–Markov method. According to the results, the AL will decrease by 0.36\% from 2030 to 2060. Between 2030 and 2060, however, the area with very high frost-affected will increase by about 10.64\%. In sum, this study accentuates the critical impacts of climate change on the FS in the region. Our findings and proposed methods could be helpful for researchers to model and quantify the climate change impacts on the FS in different regions and periods.},

	abstract = {Understanding rapid land change in the U.S. NGP region is not only critical for management and conservation of prairie habitats and ecosystem services, but also for projecting production of crops and biofuels and the impacts of land conversion on water quality and rural transportation infrastructure. Hence, it raises the need for an LCLU dataset with good spatiotemporal coverage as well as consistent accuracy through time to enable change analysis. This dissertation aims (1) to develop a novel classification method, which utilizes time series images from comparable sensors, from the perspective of land surface phenology, and (2) to apply the land cover/land use dataset generated from the phenometrically-based classification approach to quantify crop expansion in South Dakota.
A novel classification approach from the perspective of land surface phenology (LSP) uses rich time series datasets. First, surface reflectance products at 30 m spatial resolution from Landsat Collection-1, its newer structure—Landsat Analysis Ready Data, and the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data are used to construct vegetation index time series, including the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the 2-band EVI (EVI2), and various spectral variables (spectral band and normalized ratio composites). MODIS Level-3 Land Surface Temperature \& Emissivity 8-day composite products at 1 km spatial resolution from both the Aqua and Terra satellites are used to compute accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) time series. The EVI/EVI2 and AGDD time series are then fitted by two different land surface phenology models: the Convex Quadratic model and the Hybrid Piecewise Logistic Model. Suites of phenometrics are derived from the two LSP models and spectral variables and input to Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) to map land cover of sample areas in South Dakota. The results indicate that classifications using only phenometrics can accurately map major crops in the study area but show limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. RFC models using the combined spectral-phenological variables can achieve higher accuracies than those using either spectral variables or phenometrics alone, especially for the barren/developed class. Among all sampling designs, the “same distribution” models—proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population—tends to yield best land cover prediction. A “same distribution” random sample dataset covering approximately 0.25\% or more of the study area appears to achieve an accurate land cover map.
To characterize crop expansion in South Dakota, a trajectory-based analysis, which considers the entire land cover dataset generated from the LSP-based classifications, is proposed to improve change detection. An estimated cropland expansion of 5,447 km2 (equivalent to 14\% of the existing cropland area) occurred between 2007 and 2015, which matches more closely the reports from the National Agriculture Statistics Service—NASS (5,921 km2) and the National Resources Inventory—NRI (5,034 km2) than an estimation from a bi-temporal change approach (8,018 km2). Cropland gains were mostly concentrated in 10 counties in northern and central South Dakota. An evaluation of land suitability for crops using the Soil Survey Geographic Database—SSURGO indicates a scarcity in high-quality arable land available for cropland expansion.},

	abstract = {Over the last 20 years, substantial amounts of grassland have been converted to other land uses in the Northern Great Plains. Most of land cover/land use (LCLU) assessments in this region have been based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Cropland Data Layer (USDA - CDL), which may be inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate an approach to map land cover utilizing multi-temporal Earth Observation data from Landsat and MODIS. We first built an annual time series of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) from MODIS 8-day composites of land surface temperatures. Using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat Collection 1's surface reflectance, we then fit at each pixel a downward convex quadratic model to each year's progression of AGDD (i.e., EVI = α + β × AGDD − γ × AGDD2). Phenological metrics derived from fitted model and the goodness of fit then are submitted to a random forest classifier (RFC) to characterize LCLU for four sample counties in South Dakota in three years (2006, 2012, 2014) when reference point datasets are available for training and validation. To examine the sensitivity of the RFC to sample size and design, we performed classifications under different sample selection scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method accurately mapped major crops in the study area but showed limited accuracy for non-vegetated land covers. Although all RFC models exhibit high accuracy, estimated land cover areas from alternative models could vary widely, suggesting the need for a careful examination of model stability in any future land cover supervised classification study. Among all sampling designs, the “same distribution” models (proportional distribution of the sample is like proportional distribution of the population) tend to yield best land cover prediction. RFC used only the most eight important variables (e.g., three fitted parameter coefficients [α, β, and γ]; maximum modeled EVI; AGDD at maximum modeled EVI; the number of observations used to fit CxQ model; and the number of valid observations) have slightly higher accuracy compared to those using all variables. By summarizing annual image time series through land surface phenology modeling, LCLU classification can embrace both seasonality and interannual variability, thereby increasing the accuracy of LCLU change detection.},

	abstract = {The majority of glaciers in central Chile have receded in recent decades, from {\textgreater}50 m to only a few meters per year, mainly in response to an increase in the 08C isotherm altitude. The Aconcagua river basin (338 S) is one of the major glaciated basins in central Chile, with 121 km2 of ice in 2003. An earlier inventory using 1955 aerial photographs yielded a total surface area of 151 km2, implying a reduction in glacier area of 20\% (0.63 km2 a–1) over the 48 years. Photographic stereo models, high-resolution satellite images (Landsat, ASTER) and SRTM data have been used to delineate glacier basins. A focus on Glaciar Juncal Norte, one of the largest glaciers in the basin, allows a more detailed analysis of changes. The glacier has exhibited a smaller reduction (14\%) between 1955 and 2006, and the resulting elevation changes over this smaller period are not significant. The above reduction rates are lower than in other glaciers of central Chile and Argentina. This trend emphasizes water runoff availability in a river where most of the water in the dry summers is generated by glaciers and snowpack, and where most of the superficial water rights are already allocated. Ongoing hydrological research including modelling of future water runoff will improve our understanding.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration is one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle. Estimation of evapotranspiration is imperative for effective forest, irrigation, rangeland and water resources management as well as to increase yields and for better crop management. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in estimating evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of corn in the Mediterranean region of Adana province, Turkey. The Landsat 8 satellite images from March to September 2018 were used to acquire the coefficients of the respective bands. Then, the net radiation flux on the earth’s surface and the earth’s heat flux is obtained using incoming-outgoing radiation fluxes from albedo, surface emissivity coefficients, land surface temperature, and plant indicators. Next, the sensible heat flux is calculated by determining the hot and cold pixels under consideration via the atmospheric stability conditions. Finally, evapotranspiration maps are plotted. The crop coefficient of corn is also estimated with the respected maps being plotted. To validate the outcomes from the SEBAL algorithm, experimental methods were employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics. The results showed that the SEBAL generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the FAO Penman-Monteith method registering the highest correlation (R = 0.91) and the lowest error (RMSE = 1.14). In addition, the SEBAL method registered the highest correlation values of 0.89, 0.87 and 0.68 with Turk, Makkink and Hargreaves experimental methods, respectively. Moreover, the crop coefficients estimated using SEBAL also manifested an acceptable correlation with all methods. The highest correlation value registered was with the FAO Penman-Monteith method (R = 0.98). The outcomes show that since the performance of the SEBAL algorithm in estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient using Landsat 8 satellite images is acceptable, the SEBAL algorithm could be a very convenient method. Moreover, it could easily be assimilated into farming management systems and precision agriculture for better decision-making and higher yield.},

	abstract = {Monitoring spatial and temporal trends of water use is of utmost importance to ensure water and food security in river basins that are challenged by water scarcity and climate change induced abnormal weather patterns. To quantify water consumption by the agriculture sector, continuous monitoring is required over different spatial scales ranging from field ({\textless} 1 ha) to basin. The demand driven requirement of covering large areas yet providing spatially distributed information makes the use of in-situ measurement devices unfeasible. Earth observation satellites and remote sensing techniques offer an effective alternative in estimating the consumptive use of water (Actual EvapoTranspiration (ETa) fluxes) by using periodic observations from the visible and infrared spectral region. Optical satellite data, however, is often hindered by noises due to cloud cover, cloud shadow, aerosols and other satellite related issues such as Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in Landsat 7 breaking the continuity of temporal observations. These gaps have to be statistically filled in order to compute aggregated seasonal and annual estimates of ETa. In this paper, we introduce an approach to develop a gap-filled multi-year monthly ETa maps at medium spatial resolution of 30 m. The method includes two major steps: (i) estimation of ETa using the python based implementation of surface energy balance model called PySEBAL and (ii) temporal interpolation using Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) model followed by spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps over time and space. The approach is applied to a large endorheic Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) basin with a surface area of {\textasciitilde} 52,970 km2 in Iran for the years 2013–2015 using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data. The results show that the implemented gap filling approach could reconstruct the monthly ETa dynamics over different agriculture land use types, while retaining the high spatial variability. A comparison with a similar dataset from FAO WaPOR reported a very high correlation with R2 of 0.93. The study demonstrates the applicability of this approach to a larger basin which is extendible and reproducible to other geographical areas.},

The conversion of agroecosystems requires the adoption of agroecological techniques, which aim to design the agroecosystem as an integrated part of a vegetation matrix of the landscape, interconnecting the different production systems with the agricultural landscape. In order to measure the degree of connectivity of agroecosystems with the landscape, we used the Main Agroecological Structure (MAS) method, which was applied to 36 small agroecosystems of vegetable, livestock and fruit producers, which generally presented a low degree of connectivity. This allows us to evaluate the potential of these systems for agroecological transition, since being present in a moderately complex agricultural landscape gives important advantages over a more simplified system, allowing these producers to dispense with the use of many energy subsidies. This evaluation allows a first approximation to the quantification of the landscape matrix and will allow a comparison between agroecosystems or an evaluation of the evolution of the MAS over time. It is necessary to complement the MAS by quantifying the ecosystem services that may be associated with it.},

	abstract = {As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale. Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and significant progress has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data can provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are proposed for future research.},

	abstract = {Soil water status, which refers to the wetness or dryness of soils, is crucial for the productivity of agroecosystems, as it determines nutrient cycling and uptake physically via transport, biologically via the moisture-dependent activity of soil flora, fauna, and plants, and chemically via specific hydrolyses and redox reactions. Here, we focus on the dynamics of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) and review how soil water is coupled to the cycling of these elements and related stoichiometric controls across different scales within agroecosystems. These scales span processes at the molecular level, where nutrients and water are consumed, to processes in the soil pore system, within a soil profile and across the landscape. We highlight that with increasing mobility of the nutrients in water, water-based nutrient flux may alleviate or even exacerbate imbalances in nutrient supply within soils, for example, by transport of mobile nutrients towards previously depleted microsites (alleviating imbalances), or by selective loss of mobile nutrients from microsites (increasing imbalances). These imbalances can be modulated by biological activity, especially by fungal hyphae and roots, which contribute to nutrient redistribution within soils, and which are themselves dependent on specific, optimal water availability. At larger scales, such small-scale effects converge with nutrient inputs from atmospheric (wet deposition) or nonlocal sources and with nutrient losses from the soil system towards aquifers. Hence, water acts as a major control in nutrient cycling across scales in agroecosystems and may either exacerbate or remove spatial disparities in the availability of the individual nutrients (N, P, S) required for biological activity.},

	abstract = {The theories developed in ecological stoichiometry (ES) are fundamentally based on traits. Traits directly linked to cell/body stoichiometry, such as nutrient uptake and storage, as well as the associated trade-offs, have the potential to shape ecological interactions such as competition and predation within ecosystems. Further, traits that indirectly influence and are influenced by nutritional requirements, such as cell/body size and growth rate, are tightly linked to organismal stoichiometry. Despite their physiological and ecological relevance, traits are rarely explicitly integrated in the framework of ES and, currently, the major challenge is to more closely inter-connect ES with trait-based ecology (TBE). Here, we highlight four interconnected nutrient trait groups, i.e., acquisition, body stoichiometry, storage, and excretion, which alter interspecific competition in autotrophs and heterotrophs. We also identify key differences between producer-consumer interactions in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For instance, our synthesis shows that, in contrast to aquatic ecosystems, traits directly influencing herbivore stoichiometry in forested ecosystems should play only a minor role in the cycling of nutrients. We furthermore describe how linking ES and TBE can help predict the ecosystem consequences of global change. The concepts we highlight here allow us to predict that increasing N:P ratios in ecosystems should shift trait dominances in communities toward species with higher optimal N:P ratios and higher P uptake affinity, while decreasing N retention and increasing P storage.},

We partition WFs into green (water from precipitation) and blue (from irrigation or capillary rise), and differentiate between rainfed and irrigated production systems.

Yet, evaluating agriculture’s hydrological impacts and strategies to reduce them remains challenging due to a lack of field-scale data on crop water consumption. Here, we develop a method to fill this gap using remote sensing and machine learning, and leverage it to assess water saving strategies in California’s Central Valley. We find that switching to lower water intensity crops can reduce consumption by up to 93\%, but this requires adopting uncommon crop types. Northern counties have substantially lower irrigation efficiencies than southern counties, suggesting another potential source of water savings. Other practices that do not alter land cover can save up to 11\% of water consumption. These results reveal diverse approaches for achieving sustainable water use, emphasizing the potential of sub-field scale crop water consumption maps to guide water management in California and beyond.},

It reports on consumptive use of rainwater (green WF) and ground and surface water (blue WF) and volumes of water polluted (gray WF). Water footprints are estimated per nation from both a production and consumption perspective. International virtual water flows are estimated based on trade in agricultural and industrial commodities. The global annual average WF in the period 1996–2005 was 9,087 Gm3/y (74\% green, 11\% blue, 15\% gray). Agricultural production contributes 92\%. About one-fifth of the global WF relates to production for export. The total volume of international virtual water flows related to trade in agricultural and industrial products was 2,320 Gm3/y (68\% green, 13\% blue, 19\% gray). The WF of the global average consumer was 1,385 m3/y. The average consumer in the United States has a WF of 2,842 m3/y, whereas the average citizens in China and India have WFs of 1,071 and 1,089 m3/y, respectively. Consumption of cereal products gives the largest contribution to the WF of the average consumer (27\%), followed by meat (22\%) and milk products (7\%). The volume and pattern of consumption and the WF per ton of product of the products consumed are the main factors determining the WF of a consumer. The study illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution by showing that several countries heavily rely on foreign water resources and that many countries have significant impacts on water consumption and pollution elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean region is widely acknowledged as one of the most exposed in the world to the effects of climate change, water scarcity, biodiversity loss and land degradation, coupled with a nutrition transition of its populations. In such a context, to explore the evolution of the region is of both political and theoretical interest. This study presents the result of a scenario-building exercise, based on a Delphi method – an interactive forecasting technique – relying upon about 60 practitioners, experts and academics representing 19 Mediterranean countries and a wide range of disciplines and expertise. The present article has three main purposes. First, to identify the main challenges, trends and driving forces that influence the agri-food systems in the Mediterranean over a short (2020) and medium (2030) term. Second, to discuss the alternative policy responses to the challenges that the region will face in terms of water resource management, farming systems and agri-food value chains in terms of desirability and feasibility. Thirdly, to provide informed, evidence-based recommendations that might help different stakeholders to take action in the region’s agri-food sector. Based on this Delphi’s results, the study suggests that the gap between the countries in the South and the North of the Mediterranean in terms of challenges posed in water management, farming systems and the agri-food value chain is expected to grow. Experts agree that climate change is going to play a key role in the future of both sides of the Mediterranean, but with a differential impact in the sub-two regions. Nutrition-related challenges will exert a growing pressure especially in the Southern Mediterranean countries. A set of desirable and feasible policy option for addressing the Mediterranean food-related challenges are discussed.},

	abstract = {Phenology is an important indicator of annual plant growth and is also widely incorporated in ecosystem models to simulate interannual variability of ecosystem productivity under climate change. A comprehensive understanding of the potentials of current algorithms to detect the start and end for growing season (SOS and EOS) from remote sensing is still lacking. This is particularly true when considering the diverse interactions between phenology and climate change among plant functional types as well as potential influences from different sensors. Using data from 60 flux tower sites (376 site-years in total) from the global FLUXNET database, we applied four algorithms to extract plant phenology from time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from both MODIS and SPOT-VGT sensors. Results showed that NDVI-simulated phenology had overall low correlation (R2{\textless}0.30) with flux-derived SOS/EOS observations, but this predictive strength substantially varied by fitting algorithm, sensor and plant functional type. Different fitting algorithms can produce significantly different phenological estimates, but this difference can also be influenced by sensor type. SPOT-VGT simulated better EOS but no difference in the accuracy of SOS was found with different sensors. It may be due to increased frequency of data sampling (10 days for SPOT-VGT vs. 16 days for MODIS) during spring season when rapid plant growth does not help SPOT-VGT more sensitive to growth. In contrast, more frequent data acquisition favors better modeling of plant growth in autumn when a gradual decrease in photosynthesis occurs. Our study results highlight that none of these algorithm can provide consistent good accuracy in modeling SOS and EOS with respect to both plant functional types and sensors. More importantly, a rigorous validation of phenology modeling against ground data is necessary before applying these algorithms at regional or global scales and consequently previous conclusions on regional SOS/EOS trends should be viewed with caution if independent validation is lacking.},

	abstract = {Accurate monitoring of vegetation phenology (e.g., the start and end of the growing season, SOS and EOS) is helpful for understanding the impacts of climate change on vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle. The remote sensing-based vegetation index (e.g., enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and remote sensing-based phenology index (e.g., normalized difference greenness index, NDGI) are the major data sources for phenology monitoring at regional and global scales. However, these remote sensing-based indices are vulnerable to the influences of backgrounds and their variations. As a result, it is difficult to obtain high-precision vegetation phenology by using only the remote sensing-based indices, especially for the EOS. In this study, we developed a background-free phenology index (BFPI) by coupling the remote sensing-based index and the meteorological factor-based normalized growing season index (calculated by the normalized daily minimum temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and photoperiod). The BFPIs (BFPIEVI and BFPINDGI) were constructed as products of the EVI/NDGI and normalized growing season index. The performances of the BFPIs in phenology monitoring were evaluated by using the gross primary production data from 64 carbon flux towers and green chromatic coordinate data from 57 PhenoCam sites in forests and grasslands in the Northern Hemisphere. The results showed that the BFPIs performed better than the remote sensing-based indices in phenology monitoring for both forests and grasslands. The BFPINDGI performed better than the BFPIEVI for SOS monitoring, and the two BFPIs had nearly equal performances for monitoring the EOS of grasslands. For forests, the BFPIEVI performed better than the BFPINDGI in phenology monitoring. Although the performances of the BFPIs were limited for EOS monitoring, the phenology monitoring accuracy based on BFPIs were still obviously higher than that based on the remote sensing indices. Overall, the newly-developed BFPI that integrates biological and meteorological factors not only improved the precision of phenology monitoring, but also provided a new perspective for multisource data-based phenology monitoring.},

	abstract = {In Chile, mediterranean climate conditions only occur in the Central Zone (ChMZ). Despite its small area, this mediterranean climate region (med-region) has been recognised as a hotspot for biodiversity. However, in contrast to the rivers of other med-regions, the rivers in the ChMZ have been studied infrequently, and knowledge of their freshwater biodiversity is scarce and fragmented. We gathered information on the freshwater biodiversity of ChMZ, and present a review of the current knowledge of the principal floral and faunal groups. Existing knowledge indicates that the ChMZ has high levels of endemism, with many primitive species being of Gondwanan origin. Although detailed information is available on most floral groups, most faunal groups remain poorly known. In addition, numerous rivers in the ChMZ remain completely unexplored. Taxonomic specialists are scarce, and the information available on freshwater biodiversity has resulted from studies with objectives that did not directly address biodiversity issues. Research funding in this med-region has a strong applied character and is not focused on the knowledge of natural systems and their biodiversity. Species conservation policies are urgently required in this highly diverse med-region, which is also the most severely impacted and most populated region of the country.},

These MTEs possess the highest levels of plant species richness in the world outside of the wet tropics. These ecosystems include a variety of vegetation structures that range from the iconic mediterranean-type shrublands to deciduous and evergreen woodlands, evergreen forests, and herblands and grasslands. Sclerophyll vegetation similar to today\&apos;s mediterranean-type shrublands was already present on oligotrophic soils in the wet and humid climate of the Cretaceous, with fire-adapted Paleogene lineages in southwestern Australia and the Cape Region. The novel mediterranean-type climate (MTC) seasonality present since the middle Miocene has allowed colonization of MTEs from a regional species pool with associated diversification. Fire persistence has been a primary driving factor for speciation in four of the five regions. Understanding the regional patterns of plant species diversity among the MTEs involves complex interactions of geologic and climatic histories for each region as well as ecological factors that have promoted diversification in the Neogene and Quaternary. A critical element of species richness for many MTE lineages has been their ability to speciate and persist at fine spatial scales, with low rates of extinction.},

	abstract = {Changes in land use and land cover reflect anthropogenic effects in areas with a long history of human occupation, such as Mediterranean regions. To understand the landscape dynamics of a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem in Chile, we evaluated land-cover trajectories and their effects on landscape spatial patterns over a period of 36 years (1975–2011). We used landscape metrics combined with surveys of landowners to distinguish the main drivers of landscape change. General results indicated that changes in forest area followed both natural (64\%) and human-induced (36\%) trajectories. At the landscape level, fragmentation for all forest cover types increased, whereas at the class level, fragmentation of Native Forest decreased. The landscape changed from a homogeneous mosaic dominated by grazing and agriculture to a more heterogeneous environment, where natural cover had become more dominant. Thus, the use of a landscape ecology approach together with field information improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics in this landscape. This study is one of the first to assess landscape dynamics of the Mediterranean semi-arid region of Chile. This is important because it aids decision-making for biodiversity conservation in a global hotspot and land-use planning.},

	abstract = {Land use and cover changes have been identiﬁed as a major factor contributing to shape landscape structure and biodiversity patterns, particulary in areas with a long history of human occupation and habitat fragmentation, such as the Mediterranean landscapes. However, the existing studies on landscape change indicators for Mediterranean areas have mostly focused in Europe, while for other Mediterranean zones, and especially for South America, there is a serious lack of knowledge concerning the impact of landscape dynamics on ecological processes. Further research on this topic is urgently needed, given the high biodiversity levels and the rapidly increasing rates of human modiﬁcation in the Mediterranean landscapes of South America. For this purpose, we investigated the dynamics of a landscape in the semiarid region of the Mediterranean zone of Chile, and measured the effect of those dynamics on functional connectivity, during a period of about four decades (1975–2011). Landscape connectivity indicators were extracted from a series of Landsat images. The Equivalent Connnected Area index (ECA) was used as indicator of connectivity trends, and was evaluated for three representative distances of seed dispersal in the study area (150 m, 500 m and 1000 m). In addition, the patches that most contribute to maintain the present connectivity, and their roles as connectivity providers, were identiﬁed through a set of commensurable indicators: betweenness centrality and the fractions (intra, ﬂux connector) of the Integral Index of Connectivity. We found that these indicators were useful to detect and summarize a number of previously unreported trends in these Mediterranean landscapes. First, population growth and economic development were compatible with an increase in functional connectivity for forest habitats, mainly because the abandonment of marginal agricultural lands and their subsequent conversion to espinals (Acacia caven) triggered vegetation succession towards secondary forests. Second, increased forest connectivity was not associated to a decrease in the characteristic heterogeneity of Mediterranean landscapes. Third, many patches of espinal, despite being commonly regarded as of poor conservation value, were crucial to promote connectivity by acting as stepping stones among other patches with higher habitat quality. The approach here presented provides a combined assessment of landscape structure, function and change that should be valuable and applicable to deliver operational indicators in dynamic landscapes in South America and other Mediterranean regions.},

	abstract = {Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed ‘land surface phenology’, as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.},

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology is considered an important biological indicator in understanding the behaviour of ecosystems and how it responds to environmental cues. Changes in vegetation dynamics have been strongly linked to the variability of climate patterns and may have an important impact on the ecological processes of ecosystems, such as the land surface-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon, energy flows and interaction between different species. Land surface phenology (LSP) is the study of seasonal patterns in plant phenophases based on time series from vegetation indices (VI) or biophysical variables derived from satellite data, and has played an essential role in monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes from local to global scales. The goal of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global LSP research to the development of environmental knowledge and remote sensing science and technology, identifying possible gaps that could be addressed in the coming years. This systematic review found that the number of LSP studies has grown exponentially since the 1980s, although the analysis of phenological metrics or phenometrics derived from satellite data (i.e. proxies for the biological phenophases of plants) has focused specifically on ecosystems located in the mid- and high-altitude in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. boreal forest/taiga, evergreen, deciduous or mixed temperate forest). LSP studies use different satellite dataset and methods to estimate phenometrics. These studies identified an advance in spring and a delay in autumn phenophases as general trends. Although these trends were associated mainly to changes in temperature and precipitation, phenological cycle dynamics might be related to other drivers, such as photoperiod, soil moisture or organic carbon content, among others. Therefore, this interaction between different climatic and non-climatic drivers make phenology modelling a difficult task. Hence, in the coming years, a greater integration of LSP data into ecological process modelling could provide a more complete overview on the terrestrial ecosystems functioning. Furthermore, different technical and methodological aspects (e.g. greater temporal coverage of recent high-spatial-resolution satellites, advances in remote-sensing technology or improved efficiency in the computational processing of geospatial data) may also contribute to improve our understanding of Earth’s ecosystem dynamics and their environmental drivers.},

	abstract = {Forests play important roles in the Earth's climate system and global carbon cycle. Therefore, a critical need exists to improve our understanding of how the growing seasons of forests are changing, and by extension, how the composition and function of forests will respond to future climate change. Coarse spatial resolution satellite remote sensing has been widely used to monitor and map the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems at regional to global scales, and despite widespread agreement that the growing season of Northern Hemisphere forests is changing, the spatial resolution of these data sources imposes significant limitations on the character and quality of inferences that can be drawn from them. In particular, the spatial resolution afforded by instruments such as MODIS does not resolve ecologically important landscape-scale patterns in phenology. With this issue in mind, here we evaluate the ability of a newly developed Landsat phenology algorithm (LPA) to reconstruct a 32-year time series for the start and end of the growing season in North American temperate and boreal forests. We focus on 13 “sidelap” regions located between overlapping Landsat scenes that span a large geographic range of temperate and boreal forests, and evaluate the quality and character of LPA-derived start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) dates using several independent data sources. On average, SOS and EOS dates were detected for about two-thirds of the 32years included in our analysis, with the remaining one-third missing due to cloud cover. Moreover, there was generally better agreement between ground observations and LPA-derived estimates of SOS dates than for EOS across the 13 sites included in our study. Our results demonstrate that, despite the presence of time series gaps, LPA provides a robust basis for retrospective analysis of long-term changes in spring and autumn deciduous forest phenology over the last three decades. Finally, our results support the potential for monitoring land surface phenology at 30m spatial resolution in near real-time by combining time series from multiple sensors such as the Landsat Operational Land Imager and the Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument.},

We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32\%) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating ({\textasciitilde}1960–2005) and decelerating (2006–2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a dynamic process influenced by various factors, including agricultural expansion. In Chile’s Aconcagua Basin, avocado plantations are potentially driving territorial transformations. However, current land cover data lacks the resolution required to accurately assess this impact. Accordingly, our study used advanced geospatial analysis techniques to address this gap. Through a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal changes, it was determined that the most significant expansion of avocado plantations occurred between 2003 and 2013, with an increase of 402\%. This growth primarily took place at the expense of native vegetation, particularly sclerophyllous shrubland, as well as other agricultural lands, near agricultural and urban lands. By 2023, changes in avocado plantation were significantly slower, with minimal alterations in LULC (5\%), suggesting a possible influence of drought on small-scale farmers. However, the small loss of avocado plantation was mainly replaced by fruit farm land. Moreover, our findings suggest that while avocado plantations have become larger, more dominant, and more isolated, native vegetation has become more fragmented and reduced in patch size. Based on these results, sustainable land management practices were proposed. These findings provide a crucial foundation for developing sustainable land management strategies that balance agricultural production with environmental sustainability, landscape transformation and the well-being of local communities.},

	abstract = {Quantifying drought's economic impacts has been key for decision-making to build future strategies and improve the development and implementation of proactive plans. However, climate change is changing drought frequency, intensity, and durability. These changes imply modifications of their economic impact, as longer droughts result in greater cumulative economic losses for water users. Though the longer the drought lasts, other factors also play a crucial role in its economic outcomes, such as Infrastructure capacity (IC), the Amount of Water in Storage (AWS) in reservoirs and aquifers, and short- and long-term responses to it. This study proposes and applies an analytical framework for the economic assessment of long-run droughts, assessing and explaining central Chile megadrought economic effects through the factors that begin to influence the economic impact level in this setting. High levels of both IC and the AWS, as well as short- and long-term responses of water users, allow for high resilience to long-run droughts, tolerating extraordinary water disruption in its society with relatively low total economic impacts. Despite this adaptability, long-term droughts bring places to a water-critical threshold where long-term adaptation strategies may be less flexible than short-term strategies, escalating the adverse economic effects. This fact suggests that the economic evaluation of megadrought needs to focus on future tipping points (substantial water scarcity). The tipping point depends on the IC, how water users manage the AWS, and adaptation strategies. Establishing the tipping point should be a priority for future interdisciplinary research.},

	abstract = {A decade-long (2010–2020) period with precipitation deficits in central–south Chile (30–41∘ S), the so-called megadrought (MD), has led to streamflow depletions of larger amplitude than expected from precipitation anomalies, indicating an intensification in drought propagation. We analysed the catchment characteristics and runoff mechanisms modulating such intensification by using the CAMELS-CL dataset and simulations from the HBV hydrological model. We compared annual precipitation–runoff (P–R) relationships before and during the MD across 106 basins with varying snow-/rainfall regimes and identified those catchments where drought propagation was intensified. Our results show that catchments' hydrological memory – modulated by snow and groundwater – is a key control of drought propagation. Snow-dominated catchments (30–35∘ S) feature larger groundwater contribution to streamflow than pluvial basins, which we relate to the infiltration of snowmelt over the Western Andean Front. This leads to longer memory in these basins, represented by a significative correlation between autumn streamflow (when snow has already melted) and the precipitation from the preceding year. Hence, under persistent drought conditions, snow-dominated catchments accumulate the effects of precipitation deficits and progressively generate less water, compared with their historical behaviour, notably affecting central Chile, a region with limited water supply and which concentrates most of the country's population and water demands. Finally, we addressed a general question: what is worse – an extreme single-year drought or a persistent moderate drought? In snow-dominated basins, where water provision strongly depends on both the current and previous precipitation seasons, an extreme drought induces larger absolute streamflow deficits; however persistent deficits induce a more intensified propagation of the meteorological drought. Hence, the worst scenario would be an extreme meteorological drought following consecutive years of precipitation below average, as occurred in 2019. In pluvial basins of southern Chile (35–41∘ S), hydrologic memory is still an important factor, but water supply is more strongly dependant on the meteorological conditions of the current year, and therefore an extreme drought would have a higher impact on water supply than a persistent but moderate drought.},

	abstract = {Since 2010, central Chile has experienced a protracted megadrought with annual precipitation deficits ranging from 25 \% to 70 \%. An intensification of drought propagation has been attributed to the effect of cumulative precipitation deficits linked to catchment memory. Yet, the influence of water extractions on drought intensification is still unclear. Our study assesses climate and water use effects on streamflow reductions during a high-human-influence period (1988–2020) in four major agricultural basins. We performed this attribution by contrasting observed streamflow (driven by climate and water use) with near-natural streamflow simulations (driven mainly by climate) representing what would have occurred without water extractions. Near-natural streamflow estimations were obtained from rainfall–runoff models trained over a reference period with low human intervention (1960–1988). Annual and seasonal streamflow reductions were examined before and after the megadrought onset, and hydrological drought events were characterized for the complete evaluation period in terms of their frequency, duration, and intensity.

 Our results show that before the megadrought onset (1988–2009) the mean annual deficits in observed streamflow ranged between 2 \% and 20 \% across the study basins and that 81 \% to 100 \% of those deficits were explained by water extractions. During the megadrought (2010–2020), the mean annual deficits in observed streamflow were 47 \% to 76 \% among the basins. During this time, the relative contribution of precipitation deficits on streamflow reduction increased while the contribution of water extractions decreased, accounting for 27 \% to 51 \% of the streamflow reduction. Regarding drought events during the complete evaluation period, we show that human activities have amplified drought propagation, with almost double the intensity of hydrological droughts in some basins compared to those expected by precipitation deficits only. We conclude that while the primary cause of streamflow reductions during the megadrought has been the lack of precipitation, water uses have not diminished during this time, causing an exacerbation of the hydrological drought conditions and aggravating their impacts on water accessibility in rural communities and natural ecosystems.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.

 The full ERA5-Land hourly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.},

	abstract = {As the spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery has improved over the last four decades, algorithms for monitoring and mapping seasonal changes in surface properties have evolved rapidly. Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50–75\% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.},

	abstract = {Vegetation phenological trends during last few decades have been frequently reported and these trends are commonly assumed to result from climate change. With the widespread influence of both human activities and natural processes, however, land cover and land use change (LCLUC) has dominated across various ecosystems in more than one-third of world’s land surface. LCLUC could lead to changes in vegetation types and species composition at local to regional scales. Thus, we hypothesize that LCLUC can significantly influence phenological trends at an ecosystem scale. Here we tested this hypothesis in agricultural ecosystems composed of various crop types spanning the Midwest of the United States by analyzing satellite-observed land surface phenology from 1982 to 2014. Greenup onset dates in croplands occurred later at rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.67 d yr−1 at the state scale. This trend was due to significant areal increases in corn (maize) and soybean that have later emergence coupled with areal decreases in wheat and oats that have earlier emergence, despite a trend of warmer spring temperatures that aid earlier crop emergence. Overall, considering the long-term directional change in greenup onset dates across these croplands, two-thirds was attributable to LCLUC and one-third to climatic variation. This finding indicates that extensive LCLUC can be the primary driver of satellite-observed phenological trends, especially in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {El sector agrícola viene transitando un profundo cambio en la obtención y la utilización de nuevas tecnologías, buscando anticiparse a eventos edafoclimáticos que puedan inferir en los resultados productivos y facilitar la toma de decisiones de forma remota, empujando al profesional a un uso cada vez más extenso de herramientas tales como la teledetección y el manejo de información geoespacial en entornos GIS. La clasificación de imágenes provenientes de sensores remotos permite monitorear dichos cambios con precisión, en forma periódica y a menores costos que con los métodos tradicionales. Las imágenes de los satélites Landsat y Sentinel son ampliamente utilizadas para realizar clasificaciones de las coberturas del terreno, dado que presentan resoluciones espaciales convenientes, una cobertura espectral similar entre ellas y carecen de costos para su descarga y manipuleo.  
En el presente trabajo se analizaron las ventajas y desventajas del uso de imágenes satelitales de mediana resolución (LANDSAT 8 OLI y Sentinel 2 MSI) al realizar clasificaciones supervisadas de los cultivos estivales existentes en una campaña agrícola en campos ubicados en el partido de Lobos, provincia de Buenos Aires. Para el logro del objetivo se trabajó sobre 8 imágenes (cuatro Landsat 8 y cuatro Sentinel 2) que abarcan el periodo de estudio desde Noviembre del 2019 hasta Abril del 2020, empleando diferentes métodos de clasificación supervisada del complemento Semiautomatic Classification Plugin (SCP) dentro del software Qgis.  
El procedimiento ha requerido no solo de la obtención de las imágenes satelitales, su procesamiento y validación, sino también del relevamiento de datos de campo. 
Se partió del supuesto que las clasificaciones derivadas del uso de ambas imágenes no presentan variaciones provocadas por la resolución espectral, pero sí frente a las diferencias en la resolución espacial, siendo las imágenes Landsat las que mejor representan la realidad de campo para el área de estudio. 
Los resultados obtenidos no fueron congruentes con la hipótesis, ya que las imágenes que representaron mejor la realidad de campo corresponden a Sentinel 2.},

	abstract = {Agrifood systems generate significant benefits to society, including the food that nourishes us and jobs and livelihoods for over a billion people. However, their negative impacts due to unsustainable business-as-usual activities and practices are contributing to climate change, natural resource degradation and the unaffordability of healthy diets. Addressing these negative impacts is challenging, because people, businesses, governments and other stakeholders lack a complete picture of how their activities affect economic, social and environmental sustainability when they make decisions on a day-to-day basis.The State of Food and Agriculture 2023 looks into the true cost of food for sustainable agrifood systems. The report introduces the concept of hidden environmental, health and social costs and benefits of agrifood systems and proposes an approach – true cost accounting (TCA) – to assess them. To operationalize the TCA approach, the report proposes a two-phase assessment process, first relying on national-level TCA assessments to raise awareness and then moving towards in-depth and targeted evaluations to prioritize solutions and guide transformative actions. It provides a first attempt at national-level assessments for 154 countries, suggesting that global hidden costs from agrifood systems amount to at least to 10 trillion 2020 PPP dollars. The estimates indicate that low-income countries bear the highest burden of the hidden costs of agrifood systems relative to national income. Despite the preliminary nature of these estimates, the analysis reveals the urgent need to factor hidden costs into decision-making for the transformation of agrifood systems. Innovations in research and data, alongside investments in data collection and capacity building, are needed to scale the application of TCA, especially in low- and middle-income countries, so that it can become a viable tool to inform decision- and policymaking in a transparent and consistent way.},

Studies of land surface phenology (LSP) and land surface seasonality (LSS) have long been limited to visible to near infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, despite degradation by atmospheric effects and solar illumination constraints. Enhanced land surface parameters derived from passive microwave data enable improved temporal monitoring of agricultural land surface dynamics compared to the vegetation index data available from VNIR data. LSPs and LSSs in grain growing regions of the Volga River Basin of Russia and the spring wheat belts of the USA and Canada were characterized using AMSR-E enhanced land surface parameters for the period from April through October for 2003 through 2010. Growing degree-days (GDDs) were calculated from AMSR-E air temperature retrievals using both ascending and descending passes with a base of 0 ° C and then accumulated (AGDD) with an annual restart each 1 April. Tracking the AMSR-E parameters as a function of AGDD revealed the expected seasonal pattern of thermal limitation in mid-latitude croplands. Vegetation optical depth (VOD), a microwave analog of a vegetation index, was modeled as a function of AGDD with the resulting fitted convex quadratic models yielding both high coefficients of determination (r2 {\textgreater} 0.90) and phenometrics that could characterize cropland differences between the Russian and North American sites. The AMSR-E data were also able to capture the effects of the 2010 heat wave that devastated grain production in European Russia. These results showed the potential of AMSR-E in monitoring and modeling cropland dynamics.},

The land and its agriculture are being affected by climate changes in different ways, e.g., variations in annual rainfall, average temperature, heat waves, modifications in weeds, pests or microbes, global change of atmospheric CO2 or ozone level, and fluctuations in sea level. The threat of varying global climate has greatly driven the attention of scientists, as these variations are imparting negative impact on global crop production and compromising food security worldwide. According to some predicted reports, agriculture is considered the most endangered activity adversely affected by climate changes. To date, food security and ecosystem resilience are the most concerning subjects worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture is the only way to lower the negative impact of climate variations on crop adaptation, before it might affect global crop production drastically. In this review paper, we summarize the causes of climate change, stresses produced due to climate change, impacts on crops, modern breeding technologies, and biotechnological strategies to cope with climate change, in order to develop climate resilient crops. Revolutions in genetic engineering techniques can also aid in overcoming food security issues against extreme environmental conditions, by producing transgenic plants.},

	abstract = {Climate change has introduced significant challenges that can affect multiple sectors, including the agricultural one. In particular, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the world population has to find new solutions to increase the food production by 70\% by 2050. The answer to this crucial challenge is the suitable adoption and utilisation of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services, offering capabilities that can increase the productivity of the agrochemical products, such as pesticides and fertilisers and at the same time, they should minimise the functional cost. More detailed, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and specifically, the rapid evolution of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can lead to valuable and at the same time economic Precision Agriculture (PA) applications, such as aerial crop monitoring and smart spraying tasks. In this paper, we provide a survey regarding the potential use of UAVs in PA, focusing on 20 relevant applications. More specifically, first, we provide a detailed overview of PA, by describing its various aspects and technologies, such as soil mapping and production mapping as well as the role of the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Then, we discriminate and analyse the various types of UAVs based on their technical characteristics and payload. Finally, we investigate in detail 20 UAV applications that are devoted to either aerial crop monitoring processes or spraying tasks. For each application, we examine the methodology adopted, the proposed UAV architecture, the UAV type, as well as the UAV technical characteristics and payload.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a global threat to the food and nutritional security of the world. As greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted to rise by 2 °C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The concentration of CO2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photosynthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed flora, and reduced crop duration. Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an influence on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact.},

Soil degradation, therefore, poses a threat to food security, as it reduces yield, forces farmers to use more inputs, and may eventually lead to soil abandonment. Unfortunately, the importance of preserving soil health appears to be overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, I first briefly introduce the present situation concerning agricultural production, natural resources, soil degradation, land use and the challenge ahead, to show how these issues are strictly interwoven. Then, I define soil degradation and present a review of its typologies and estimates at a global level. I discuss the importance of preserving soil capital, and its relationship to human civilization and food security. Trends concerning the availability of arable agricultural land, different scenarios, and their limitations, are analyzed and discussed. The possible relation between an increase in a country’s GNP, population and future availability of arable land is also analyzed, using the World Bank’s database. I argue that because of the many sources of uncertainty in the data, and the high risks at stake, a precautionary approach should be adopted when drawing scenarios. The paper ends with a discussion on the key role of preserving soil organic matter, and the need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. I also argue that both our relation with nature and natural resources and our lifestyle need to be reconsidered.},

There was limited support for homogenization of urban diversity, as the cultivated and spontaneous yard flora had greater numbers of species than natural areas, and cultivated phylogenetic diversity was also greater. However, urban yards showed evidence of homogenization of composition and structure. Yards were compositionally more similar across regions than were natural areas, and tree density was less variable in yards than in comparable natural areas. This homogenization of biodiversity likely reflects similar horticultural source pools, homeowner preferences, and management practices across U.S. cities.},

We combine our continental survey results with a global meta-analysis of available sequencing data that cover more than 2400 samples across six continents. Our combined results demonstrate that land conversion to agricultural land results in taxonomic and functional homogenization of soil bacteria, mainly driven by the increase in the geographic ranges of taxa in croplands. We find that 20\% of phylotypes are decreased and 23\% are increased by land conversion, with croplands enriched in Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, Planctomycetota, Myxcoccota and Latescibacterota. Although there is no significant difference in functional composition between natural ecosystems and agricultural land, functional genes involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphorus mineralization and transportation are depleted in cropland. Our results provide a global insight into the consequences of land-use change on soil microbial taxonomic and functional diversity.},

	abstract = {To mitigate biodiversity loss from agriculture, intensification is often promoted as an alternative to farmland expansion. However, its local impacts remain debated. We assess globally the responses of three biodiversity metrics—species richness, total abundance and relative community abundance-weighted average range size (RCAR), a proxy for biotic homogenization—to land conversion and yield increases. Our models predict a median species loss of 11\% in primary vegetation in modified landscapes, and of 25\% and 40\% in cropland within natural and modified landscapes, respectively. Land conversion also reduces abundance and increases biotic homogenization, with impacts varying by geographic region and history of human modification. However, increasing yields changes biodiversity as well, including in adjacent primary vegetation, with effects dependent on crop, region, biodiversity metric and natural habitat cover. Ultimately, neither expansion nor intensification consistently benefits biodiversity. Intensification has better species richness outcomes in 29\%, 83\%, 64\% and 57\% of maize, soybean, wheat and rice landscapes, respectively, whereas expansion performs better in the remaining areas. In terms of abundance and RCAR, both expansion and intensification can outperform the other depending on landscape. Therefore, minimizing local biodiversity loss requires a context-dependent balance between expansion and intensification, while avoiding expansion in unmodified landscapes.},

	abstract = {Biotic homogenisation is defined as decreasing dissimilarity among ecological assemblages sampled within a given spatial area over time. Biotic differentiation, in turn, is defined as increasing dissimilarity over time. Overall, changes in the spatial dissimilarities among assemblages (termed ‘beta diversity’) is an increasingly recognised feature of broader biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. Empirical evidence of biotic homogenisation and biotic differentiation remains scattered across different ecosystems. Most meta-analyses quantify the prevalence and direction of change in beta diversity, rather than attempting to identify underlying ecological drivers of such changes. By conceptualising the mechanisms that contribute to decreasing or increasing dissimilarity in the composition of ecological assemblages across space, environmental managers and conservation practitioners can make informed decisions about what interventions may be required to sustain biodiversity and can predict potential biodiversity outcomes of future disturbances. We systematically reviewed and synthesised published empirical evidence for ecological drivers of biotic homogenisation and differentiation across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater realms to derive conceptual models that explain changes in spatial beta diversity. We pursued five key themes in our review: (i) temporal environmental change; (ii) disturbance regime; (iii) connectivity alteration and species redistribution; (iv) habitat change; and (v) biotic and trophic interactions. Our first conceptual model highlights how biotic homogenisation and differentiation can occur as a function of changes in local (alpha) diversity or regional (gamma) diversity, independently of species invasions and losses due to changes in species occurrence among assemblages. Second, the direction and magnitude of change in beta diversity depends on the interaction between spatial variation (patchiness) and temporal variation (synchronicity) of disturbance events. Third, in the context of connectivity and species redistribution, divergent beta diversity outcomes occur as different species have different dispersal characteristics, and the magnitude of beta diversity change associated with species invasions also depends strongly on alpha and gamma diversity prior to species invasion. Fourth, beta diversity is positively linked with spatial environmental variability, such that biotic homogenisation and differentiation occur when environmental heterogeneity decreases or increases, respectively. Fifth, species interactions can influence beta diversity via habitat modification, disease, consumption (trophic dynamics), competition, and by altering ecosystem productivity. Our synthesis highlights the multitude of mechanisms that cause assemblages to be more or less spatially similar in composition (taxonomically, functionally, phylogenetically) through time. We consider that future studies should aim to enhance our collective understanding of ecological systems by clarifying the underlying mechanisms driving homogenisation or differentiation, rather than focusing only on reporting the prevalence and direction of change in beta diversity, per se.},

Despite documented losses of species richness, consequences for β-diversity, changes in community composition between sites, are largely unknown, especially in the tropics. Using a 10-year data set on Costa Rican birds, we find that low-intensity agriculture sustained β-diversity across large scales on a par with forest. In high-intensity agriculture, low local (α) diversity inflated β-diversity as a statistical artefact. Therefore, at small spatial scales, intensive agriculture appeared to retain β-diversity. Unlike in forest or low-intensity systems, however, high-intensity agriculture also homogenised vegetation structure over large distances, thereby decoupling the fundamental ecological pattern of bird communities changing with geographical distance. This 40\% decline in species turnover indicates a significant decline in β-diversity at large spatial scales. These findings point the way towards multi-functional agricultural systems that maintain agricultural productivity while simultaneously conserving biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The Amazon rainforest is the Earth’s largest reservoir of plant and animal diversity, and it has been subjected to especially high rates of land use change, primarily to cattle pasture. This conversion has had a strongly negative effect on biological diversity, reducing the number of plant and animal species and homogenizing communities. We report here that microbial biodiversity also responds strongly to conversion of the Amazon rainforest, but in a manner different from plants and animals. Local taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of soil bacteria increases after conversion, but communities become more similar across space. This homogenization is driven by the loss of forest soil bacteria with restricted ranges (endemics) and results in a net loss of diversity. This study shows homogenization of microbial communities in response to human activities. Given that soil microbes represent the majority of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems and are intimately involved in ecosystem functions, we argue that microbial biodiversity loss should be taken into account when assessing the impact of land use change in tropical forests.},

Conversion to agriculture is destroying and degrading semi-natural ecosystems while conventional land-use intensification (e.g. industrial management of large-scale monocultures with high chemical inputs) homogenises landscape structure and quality. Together, these anthropogenic processes reduce the connectivity of populations and erode floral and nesting resources to undermine pollinator abundance and diversity, and ultimately pollination services. Ecological intensification of agriculture represents a strategic alternative to ameliorate these drivers of pollinator decline while supporting sustainable food production, by promoting biodiversity beneficial to agricultural production through management practices such as intercropping, crop rotations, farm-level diversification and reduced agrochemical use. We critically evaluate its potential to address and reverse the land use and management trends currently degrading pollinator communities and potentially causing widespread pollination deficits. We find that many of the practices that constitute ecological intensification can contribute to mitigating the drivers of pollinator decline. Our findings support ecological intensification as a solution to pollinator declines, and we discuss ways to promote it in agricultural policy and practice.},

	abstract = {The evidence that most agricultural landscapes are failing to deliver on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision suggests that future landscapes will need to be more explicitly designed. Although recent research has produced a number of ecological and social principles that should form the basis of agricultural landscape design process, implementation is still in its infancy. One difficulty is the context-dependency of ecological responses and the resulting limiting capacity to predict the benefits of landscape transformation for the targeted organisms or services. In addition, there is a poor understanding of the obstacles to and levers for the implementation of collective management at the landscape scale. In this paper, we argue that Landscape Monitoring Networks (LMN), i.e. long-term and standardized monitoring of ecological and managerial processes within a set of replicated regional landscapes, can contribute to tackling these issues. We first present the current challenges in designing agroecological landscapes before outlining the principles of LMN and how these research facilities could help deliver ecological and social understanding along a gradient from place-based to generic knowledge. We then discuss critical issues that need to be solved to ensure that LMN delivers relevant knowledge for landscape design. We illustrate this through the experience of an ongoing LMN that was created in France in 2014 to address biodiversity and pest control services in agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {Soils are the most complex and diverse ecosystem in the world. In addition to providing humanity with 98.8\% of its food, soils provide a broad range of other services, from carbon storage and greenhouse gas regulation, to flood mitigation and providing support for our sprawling cities. But soil is a finite resource, and rapid human population growth coupled with increasing consumption is placing unprecedented pressure on soils through the intensification of agricultural production – the increasing of crop yield per unit area of soil. Indeed, the human population has increased from ca. 250 million in the year 1000, to 6.1 billion in the year 2000, and is projected to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. The current intensification of agricultural practices is already resulting in the unsustainable degradation of soils. Major forms of this degradation include the loss of organic matter and the release of greenhouse gases, the over-application of fertilizers, erosion, contamination, acidification, salinization, and loss of genetic diversity. This ongoing soil degradation is decreasing the long-term ability of soils to provide humans with services, including future food production, and is causing environmental harm. It is imperative that the global society is not shortsighted by focusing solely on the near-immediate benefits of soils, such as food supply. A failure to identify the importance of soil within increasingly intensive agricultural systems will undoubtedly have serious consequences for humanity and represents a failure to consider intergenerational equity. Of utmost importance is the need to unequivocally recognize that the degradation of soils leads to a clear economic cost through the loss of services, with such principles needing to be explicitly considered in economic frameworks and decision-making processes at all levels of governance. We contend that the concept of the Water-Food-Energy nexus must be expanded, forming the Water-Soil-Food-Energy nexus.},

Statistical treatment was directed to the application of descriptive analysis and
regression of temporal data using RStudio©. The use of the MapBiomas© Web application
of the QGIS© Geographic Information System and RStudio© as tools to map and analyze
land use and coverage provided satisfactory results with speed and precision, as well as
simplicity and good quality of the results obtained in relation to other methodologies. It
was observed that there were significant changes in areas in the Forest class with a loss
of 9.56\% in area and in the Agricultural class there was an increase in area by 9.74\%.
The largest deviations were observed in the Non-Forest Natural Formation and
Agricultural classes. The distribution was not symmetrical, the kurtosis indicated a
platykurtic distribution, where the greatest variations in amplitude and irregular

	abstract = {Ecosystem service assessment has recently become one of the most important scientific frameworks to address the challenges inherent in environmental management, particularly those in agroecosystem management. Agroecosystems provide important ecosystem services to society including provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. However, the Mediterranean Basin agroecosystems have suffered the effects of two drivers of change, rural abandonment and intensification of agrarian practices, which threaten multifunctional landscapes and erode the capacity to deliver ecosystem services. In this study, we explored the knowledge landscape of ecosystem services research throughout the Mediterranean Basin's agroecosystems through a review of 165 publications. We (1) analyzed the current research state and trends; (2) examined the existing research gaps and biases; and (3) evaluated the associations between factors related to the methodologies employed, the ecosystem services analyzed, and the agroecosystem characteristics. Our results indicated that monetary approaches and provisioning ecosystem services are attracting most of the scientific attention, possibly jeopardizing the regulating and cultural services provided by these ecosystems. Moreover, results suggested that there is a lack of integrated approaches that consider the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. biophysical, sociocultural and monetary. Most studies did not use primary data or involve stakeholders in the assessments and scarce evidence was available regarding ecosystem services provided under different management alternatives. Finally, specific relationships were detected between the methodologies applied, the ecosystem services assessed and the characteristics of the agroecosystem. We argue these gaps might have potential implications in current scientific and political debates, such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and the Common Agricultural Policy reform. We therefore provide recommendations for research and policy-making, agendas.},

Analyzing the characteristics and direction of the global spatial transformation of cultivated land is of great significance in clarifying the spatial extent and quality of global cultivated land and ensuring global food security. In this context, this paper uses the global spatial data of cultivated land from 1992 to 2015 to analyze the characteristics of global cultivated land spatial transformation from the perspectives of cultivated land quantity, cultivated land landscape pattern, and cultivated land management pattern, applying the Mann-Kendall trend tests, trend analysis, landscape pattern index measures, and global rural per capita cultivated indicators. The global cultivated land area increased, followed by a decrease, during the study period; there were three distinct phases of change, with the years 1995 and 2005 as turning points. During the first phase, the global cultivated land area increased at an average annual rate of 0.19 \%, in the second phase, the increase rate was 0.30 \%, and in the third phase, the increase rate was −0.003 \%. Based on the trend of cultivated land change during the study period, the areas with a dramatic change in cultivated land area were classified into six typical hotspot areas, involving the increase and decrease of area change in 10 different countries. The two countries with the largest increases in cultivated land area are Sweden and Brazil (24.82 \% and 24.43 \%, respectively), whereas Ukraine's cultivated land area decreased throughout the study period.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 101–112 Abstract Biodiversity in agricultural landscapes can be increased with conversion of some production lands into ‘more-natural’– unmanaged or extensively managed – lands. However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ‘functional landscape heterogeneity’. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.},

	abstract = {Agricultural landscape homogenization has detrimental effects on biodiversity and key ecosystem services. Increasing agricultural landscape heterogeneity by increasing seminatural cover can help to mitigate biodiversity loss. However, the amount of seminatural cover is generally low and difficult to increase in many intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We hypothesized that increasing the heterogeneity of the crop mosaic itself (hereafter “crop heterogeneity”) can also have positive effects on biodiversity. In 8 contrasting regions of Europe and North America, we selected 435 landscapes along independent gradients of crop diversity and mean field size. Within each landscape, we selected 3 sampling sites in 1, 2, or 3 crop types. We sampled 7 taxa (plants, bees, butterflies, hoverflies, carabids, spiders, and birds) and calculated a synthetic index of multitrophic diversity at the landscape level. Increasing crop heterogeneity was more beneficial for multitrophic diversity than increasing seminatural cover. For instance, the effect of decreasing mean field size from 5 to 2.8 ha was as strong as the effect of increasing seminatural cover from 0.5 to 11\%. Decreasing mean field size benefited multitrophic diversity even in the absence of seminatural vegetation between fields. Increasing the number of crop types sampled had a positive effect on landscape-level multitrophic diversity. However, the effect of increasing crop diversity in the landscape surrounding fields sampled depended on the amount of seminatural cover. Our study provides large-scale, multitrophic, cross-regional evidence that increasing crop heterogeneity can be an effective way to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes without taking land out of agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification is one of the main causes for the current biodiversity crisis. While reversing habitat loss on agricultural land is challenging, increasing the farmland configurational heterogeneity (higher field border density) and farmland compositional heterogeneity (higher crop diversity) has been proposed to counteract some habitat loss. Here, we tested whether increased farmland configurational and compositional heterogeneity promote wild pollinators and plant reproduction in 229 landscapes located in four major western European agricultural regions. High-field border density consistently increased wild bee abundance and seed set of radish (Raphanus sativus), probably through enhanced connectivity. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of crop–crop borders for pollinator movement as an additional experiment showed higher transfer of a pollen analogue along crop–crop borders than across fields or along semi-natural crop borders. By contrast, high crop diversity reduced bee abundance, probably due to an increase of crop types with particularly intensive management. This highlights the importance of crop identity when higher crop diversity is promoted. Our results show that small-scale agricultural systems can boost pollinators and plant reproduction. Agri-environmental policies should therefore aim to halt and reverse the current trend of increasing field sizes and to reduce the amount of crop types with particularly intensive management.},

	abstract = {Context While the concept of ecosystem services (ES) is well established in the scientific and policy arenas, its operationalization faces many challenges. Indeed, ES supply, demand and flow are related to ecological and social processes at multiple space and time scales, leading to complex interactions in the provision of multiple ES. Objectives To develop a conceptual framework (CF) to facilitate the study and governance of multiple ES in agricultural social-ecological landscapes. Method We examined the ecological and social literatures to identify how approaches at the landscape level contribute to a better understanding of ES supply, demand and flow in agricultural systems. After detailing our CF, we use a case study to illustrate how methods from different disciplines can be combined to operationalize our CF. Results The literature suggests that the landscape level is likely to be the level of organization that will make it possible to (i) integrate different components of ES co-production, i.e. ecological processes, agricultural practices and social structures, (ii) understand interactions between stakeholders, including ES co-producers and beneficiaries, (iii) explicit ES trade-offs, i.e. social choices between ES. Conclusion The production of multiple ES at the landscape level involves different types of interdependencies among ES co-producers and beneficiaries. These need to be addressed in concerted and integrated ways to achieve sustainable and equitable governance of agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {Farming intensity and landscape heterogeneity influence agrobiodiversity and associated ecological functions. The relative contributions of these agroecosystem components to agricultural production remain unclear because of inter-relations and weather-dependant variations. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we estimated direct and indirect contributions of farming intensity (soil management, pesticide use and fertilisation) and landscape heterogeneity (of semi-natural covers and crop mosaic) to cereal crop production, in 54 fields (mostly wheat), in two years (24 and 30 fields). Indirect effects were evaluated through agrobiodiversity (carabid and plant communities) and ecological functions (pollination and pest control). In 2016, farming intensity had the largest direct positive effect on cereal crop yield, followed by agrobiodiversity (74\% of the farming intensity impact) and ecological functions. However, the direct benefits of farming intensity were halved due to negative indirect effects, as farming intensity negatively affected within-field biodiversity and ecological functions. Overall, agrobiodiversity and farming intensity had equal net contributions to cereal crop yields, while heterogeneity of the crop mosaic enhanced biodiversity. In 2017, neither higher farming intensity nor agrobiodiversity and ecological functions could lift cereal production, which suffered from unfavourable meteorological conditions. Semi-natural habitats supported agrobiodiversity. Our study suggests that a reduction of farming intensity combined with higher heterogeneity of crop mosaic can enhance the benefits of ecological functions towards crop production. Semi-natural covers seem to play an essential role in the face of climatic events, by supporting agrobiodiversity and the potential resilience of the agroecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Context Since the nineteenth century, rural areas have experienced progressive abandonment mostly due to socioeconomic changes, with direct and indirect effects on forest disturbance regimes occurring in these human-dominated landscapes. The role of land abandonment in modifying disturbance regimes has been highlighted for some types of disturbances, albeit being still somewhat overlooked compared to climate change. Objectives This literature review is aimed at highlighting the most relevant effects of land abandonment and land-use legacy on the regime of different types of forest disturbances, providing insight into land-use change/disturbances interactions. Methods We searched in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant studies at the global scale dealing with eight major natural disturbances: avalanche, flooding, herbivory, insect outbreak, landslide, rockfall, wildfire and windthrow. We classified papers into five relevance classes, with the highest score (4) assigned to studies quantitatively measuring the interactions between abandonment dynamics and disturbance regimes. Results Most papers focused on wildfires in Mediterranean Europe in the twentieth century, where landscape homogenisation and fuel build-up contributed to worsening their frequency, size and severity. Dense forests developed following land abandonment instead exert inhibiting effects toward mass movements such as avalanches, rockfalls and landslides. Regarding the other investigated disturbances, we found only a few studies presenting site-specific and partly contrasting effects. Conclusions Land abandonment triggers ecological processes at the landscape scale, altering land cover patterns and vegetation communities, which in turn affect disturbance regimes. Implications for land and resource management mostly depend on the stage at which post-abandonment secondary succession has developed.},

	abstract = {Our global impact is finally receiving the scientific attention it deserves. The outcome will largely determine the future course of evolution. Human-modified ecosystems are shaped by our activities and their side effects. They share a common set of traits including simplified food webs, landscape homogenization, and high nutrient and energy inputs. Ecosystem simplification is the ecological hallmark of humanity and the reason for our evolutionary success. However, the side effects of our profligacy and poor resource practices are now so pervasive as to threaten our future no less than that of biological diversity itself. This article looks at human impact on ecosystems and the consequences for evolution. It concludes that future evolution will be shaped by our awareness of the global threats, our willingness to take action, and our ability to do so. Our ability is presently hampered by several factors, including the poor state of ecosystem and planetary knowledge, ignorance of human impact, lack of guidelines for sustainability, and a paucity of good policies, practices, and incentives for adopting those guidelines in daily life. Conservation philosophy, science, and practice must be framed against the reality of human-dominated ecosystems, rather than the separation of humanity and nature underlying the modern conservation movement. The steps scientists can take to imbed science in conservation and conservation in the societal process affecting the future of ecosystems and human well-being are discussed.},

	abstract = {In densely populated areas like the Mediterranean, wildfire extent is mostly limited by fire suppression and fuel fragmentation. Fire is known to spread more easily through high fuel loads and homogenous terrain and it is supposed to reduce fuel amount and continuity, creating a negative feedback. Here we combine information from administration fire records, satellite imagery fire scars and land use/cover maps to asses the effects of fire on landscape structure and vice versa for three areas in Catalonia (NE Spain). We worked with three spatial focuses: the actual fire scar, 1km2 squares and 10km2 squares. In these regions agriculture land abandonment has lead to increased fuel continuity, paralleled by an increment of fire size. We confirm that fire spread is facilitated by land use/cover types with high fuel load and by homogeneous terrain and that fire reduces fuel load by transforming forests into shrublands. But we also found that fire increased landscape homogeneity, creating a positive feedback on fire propagation. We argue that this is possible in landscapes with finer grain than fire alone would create. The lack of discontinuities in the fuel bed diminishes the extinction capacity of fire brigades and increases the risk of large fires. We recommend that fire management should focus more on conservation of the traditional rural mosaic in order to prevent further increases in fuel continuity and fire risk.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need for an assessment of the impacts of land use and land use change (LUCC). In this context, simulation models are valuable tools for investigating the impacts of stakeholder actions or policy decisions. Agricultural landscape generators (ALGs), which systematically and automatically generate realistic but simplified representations of land cover in agricultural landscapes, can provide the input for LUCC models. We reviewed existing ALGs in terms of their objectives, design and scope. We found eight ALGs that met our definition. They were based either on generic mathematical algorithms (pattern-based) or on representations of ecological or land use processes (process-based). Most ALGs integrate only a few landscape metrics, which limits the design of the landscape pattern and thus the range of applications. For example, only a few specific farming systems have been implemented. We conclude that existing ALGs contain useful approaches that can be used for specific purposes, but ideally generic modular ALGs are developed that can be used for a wide range of scenarios, regions and model types. We have compiled features of such generic ALGs and propose a possible software architecture. Considerable joint efforts are required to develop such generic ALGs, but the benefits in terms of a better understanding and development of more efficient agricultural policies would be high.},

	abstract = {To mitigate biodiversity loss from agriculture, intensification is often promoted as an alternative to farmland expansion. However, its local impacts remain debated. We assess globally the responses of three biodiversity metrics—species richness, total abundance and relative community abundance-weighted average range size (RCAR), a proxy for biotic homogenization—to land conversion and yield increases. Our models predict a median species loss of 11\% in primary vegetation in modified landscapes, and of 25\% and 40\% in cropland within natural and modified landscapes, respectively. Land conversion also reduces abundance and increases biotic homogenization, with impacts varying by geographic region and history of human modification. However, increasing yields changes biodiversity as well, including in adjacent primary vegetation, with effects dependent on crop, region, biodiversity metric and natural habitat cover. Ultimately, neither expansion nor intensification consistently benefits biodiversity. Intensification has better species richness outcomes in 29\%, 83\%, 64\% and 57\% of maize, soybean, wheat and rice landscapes, respectively, whereas expansion performs better in the remaining areas. In terms of abundance and RCAR, both expansion and intensification can outperform the other depending on landscape. Therefore, minimizing local biodiversity loss requires a context-dependent balance between expansion and intensification, while avoiding expansion in unmodified landscapes.},

Security is used here for soil in the same sense that it is used widely for food and water. It is argued that soil has an integral part to play in the global environmental sustainability challenges of food security, water security, energy sustainability, climate stability, biodiversity, and ecosystem service delivery. Indeed, soil has the same existential status as these issues and should be recognized and highlighted similarly. The concept of soil security is multi-dimensional. It acknowledges the five dimensions of (1) capability, (2) condition, (3) capital, (4) connectivity and (5) codification, of soil entities which encompass the social, economic and biophysical sciences and recognize policy and legal frameworks. The soil security concept is compared with the cognate, but more limited, notions of soil quality, health and protection.},

Analyzing the characteristics and direction of the global spatial transformation of cultivated land is of great significance in clarifying the spatial extent and quality of global cultivated land and ensuring global food security. In this context, this paper uses the global spatial data of cultivated land from 1992 to 2015 to analyze the characteristics of global cultivated land spatial transformation from the perspectives of cultivated land quantity, cultivated land landscape pattern, and cultivated land management pattern, applying the Mann-Kendall trend tests, trend analysis, landscape pattern index measures, and global rural per capita cultivated indicators. The global cultivated land area increased, followed by a decrease, during the study period; there were three distinct phases of change, with the years 1995 and 2005 as turning points. During the first phase, the global cultivated land area increased at an average annual rate of 0.19 \%, in the second phase, the increase rate was 0.30 \%, and in the third phase, the increase rate was −0.003 \%. Based on the trend of cultivated land change during the study period, the areas with a dramatic change in cultivated land area were classified into six typical hotspot areas, involving the increase and decrease of area change in 10 different countries. The two countries with the largest increases in cultivated land area are Sweden and Brazil (24.82 \% and 24.43 \%, respectively), whereas Ukraine's cultivated land area decreased throughout the study period.},

	abstract = {Monitoring spatial and temporal trends of water use is of utmost importance to ensure water and food security in river basins that are challenged by water scarcity and climate change induced abnormal weather patterns. To quantify water consumption by the agriculture sector, continuous monitoring is required over different spatial scales ranging from field ({\textless} 1 ha) to basin. The demand driven requirement of covering large areas yet providing spatially distributed information makes the use of in-situ measurement devices unfeasible. Earth observation satellites and remote sensing techniques offer an effective alternative in estimating the consumptive use of water (Actual EvapoTranspiration (ETa) fluxes) by using periodic observations from the visible and infrared spectral region. Optical satellite data, however, is often hindered by noises due to cloud cover, cloud shadow, aerosols and other satellite related issues such as Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in Landsat 7 breaking the continuity of temporal observations. These gaps have to be statistically filled in order to compute aggregated seasonal and annual estimates of ETa. In this paper, we introduce an approach to develop a gap-filled multi-year monthly ETa maps at medium spatial resolution of 30 m. The method includes two major steps: (i) estimation of ETa using the python based implementation of surface energy balance model called PySEBAL and (ii) temporal interpolation using Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) model followed by spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps over time and space. The approach is applied to a large endorheic Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) basin with a surface area of {\textasciitilde} 52,970 km2 in Iran for the years 2013–2015 using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data. The results show that the implemented gap filling approach could reconstruct the monthly ETa dynamics over different agriculture land use types, while retaining the high spatial variability. A comparison with a similar dataset from FAO WaPOR reported a very high correlation with R2 of 0.93. The study demonstrates the applicability of this approach to a larger basin which is extendible and reproducible to other geographical areas.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a 14-channel imaging instrument operating on NASA’s Terra satellite since 1999. ASTER’s visible–near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional VNIR band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In 2009, the ASTER Science Team released Version 1 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.2 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (\&sim;30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. The GDEM covers all of the Earth’s land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. Version 2 was released in 2011, with notable improvements in coverage and accuracy. In 2019, the final, Version 3, was released; again improving on coverage and removing almost all artifacts. Th GDEM is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 110+ million 1\&times;1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.},

En esta materia, se disponía, hasta ahora, de una clasificación de cuencas proveniente de estudios que datan del año 1978. Esta presentaba un sinnúmero de problemas técnicos y administrativos, que afectaban la administración de la información a nivel de cuencas, presentando de limitaciones sin un criterio estrictamente de jerarquía hídrica. El desarrollo económico nacional en las últimas décadas ha significado gran presión sobre el uso y la disponibilidad de los recursos hídricos que escurren por las cuencas, haciendo más complejos los análisis requeridos para generar balances y establecer disponibilidades, por lo que se requiere de organización y precisión de la información de base. Consecuentemente, la información de las unidades de análisis, en este caso las cuencas, requieren un cambio que permita incorporar mejoras en el acopio, sistematización, análisis y tratamiento de la información de recursos hídricos del país, lo que se traduce en la necesidad de una nueva arquitectura de la información, basada en una clasificación de cuencas adecuada al tratamiento de información cartográfica digital. Asumiendo este desafío, la Dirección General de Aguas estableció la necesidad de redefinir las cuencas hidrográficas de Chile, actualizando, mejorando y modernizando las fuentes de información gráfica y alfanumérica existentes, mediante el uso de tecnologías de avanzada en materia de generación y manejo de información. La modernización de esta clasificación de cuencas hidrográficas no fue fácil y significó un intenso análisis multidisciplinario compuesto por expertos en diversas áreas relacionadas, para configurar un sistema de clasificación que considera la irregular fisiografía, configurando situaciones muy diversas en el escurrimiento de las aguas y organización de las cuencas. En este marco, la cartografía que se presenta entrega una nueva clasificación de cuencas hidrográficas, realizada con abundante información geográfica y técnicas geomáticas basada en una jerarquización con criterios hídricos.},

	abstract = {Rainfall variability and water scarcity continue to hamper the food and income security of smallholder farming systems in poverty-affected regions. Innovations in soil and water management, especially in the drylands, are critical for meeting food security and water productivity targets of Agenda 2030. This study analyzes how rainfed agriculture can be intensified with marginal impact on the landscape water balance. The impact of rainwater harvesting structures on landscape hydrology and associated agricultural services was analyzed in the semi-arid Jhansi district of Bundelkhand region in central India. The Parasai-Sindh pilot watershed was subjected to a 5-year (2012–2016) monitoring of rainfed system improvements in water availability and crop intensification due to surface water storage (haveli system), check dams, and field infiltration structures. Hydrological processes were monitored intensively to analyze the landscape’s water balance components. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures altered the landscape’s hydrology, limiting average surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 150 mm/year over the study period. Groundwater levels increased by 2–5 m (m), alleviating water scarcity issues of the communities in recurring dry years. Nearly 20\% of fallow lands were brought under cultivation. Crop yields increased by 10–70\% and average household income increased from US\$ 960/year to US\$ 2700/year compared to that in the non-intervention landscape. The combined soil–water–vegetation efforts strengthened water resilience and environmental systems in agricultural landscape.},
